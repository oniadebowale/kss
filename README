kss - browser security via keystroke biometrics

The main goal of this browser extension is to use keystroke data as a
biometric to secure the user on a browser. In order to do this, the
extension needs to collect some user data. The data that this extension
collects are limited to and include:

- keystroke data on websites
- mouse click data on websites
- time spent on websites

This document is a loose recollection/specification about how keystrokes are
extracted from a user's browsing.

The main idea is that JavaScript is injected onto browser pages. The JavaScript
loads a keylogger and extracts key press information for certain keys, sending
the information to an outside server via XmlHttp. On Chrome, which has more lax
cross-origin policies, it would be possible to send this information to an
outside server, but for Firefox, it will be a little harder.
